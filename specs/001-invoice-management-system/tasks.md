# Tasks: Company Invoice Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-invoice-management-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: Following TDD principles per constitution - tests are REQUIRED and written BEFORE implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project structure follows ASP.NET Core WebAPI conventions:
- Main project: `InvoiceManagement/`
- Test project: `InvoiceManagement.Tests/`
- Docker tooling: `dotnet-docker/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Basic Invoice Entry - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Invoice Listing - Independent (uses invoices from US1 for testing)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Invoice Modification - Independent (extends US1 endpoints)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Payment Status Tracking - Independent (extends Invoice entity from Foundation)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Data Export - Independent (uses filtering from US2)
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: RBAC - Independent (adds auth to existing endpoints)
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Invoice Deletion - Independent (adds delete endpoint + audit)

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
2. DTOs before services
3. Service interfaces before implementations
4. Services before controllers
5. Controllers before authorization attributes
6. Core implementation before integration with other stories
7. Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T002, T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 can all run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T008, T009, T010 (enums) can run in parallel
- T011, T012, T013, T014, T015 (entities) can run in parallel after enums
- T023, T024, T025, T026 can run in parallel after migrations

**Within Each User Story**:
- All tests for a story can run in parallel (marked [P])
- All DTOs for a story can run in parallel (marked [P])
- All parallel-marked tasks within a story

**Across User Stories** (after Foundation complete):
- Different team members can work on US1, US2, US3, etc. simultaneously
- Each story is independently testable

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Parallel Tasks:
- T031: Integration test POST /api/invoices returns 201
- T032: Integration test POST with missing fields returns 400
- T033: Integration test GET /api/invoices/{id} returns details
- T034: Integration test duplicate invoice number returns 409

# Launch all DTOs for User Story 1 together:
Parallel Tasks:
- T035: Create CreateInvoiceRequest DTO
- T036: Create InvoiceResponse DTO
```

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Enums (can all run in parallel):
- T008: InvoiceType enum
- T009: PaymentStatus enum
- T010: UserRole enum

# Entities (can all run in parallel after enums):
- T011: User entity
- T012: BusinessPartner entity
- T013: Invoice entity
- T014: InvoiceLock entity
- T015: AuditLogEntry entity
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Invoice Entry)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Invoice Listing/Filtering)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US2 independently
6. Deploy/demo MVP (create and query invoices)

**Rationale**: US1 + US2 together provide core value - accountants can enter invoices and find them. Both are P1 priority.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP complete)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (edit capability)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (payment tracking)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (export)
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (RBAC)
8. Add User Story 7 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (deletion + audit)
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team** completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done (after T030):
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T031-T045)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T046-T059)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 6 (T103-T121) - can start early as it adds auth to existing endpoints
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Continue with remaining stories (US3, US4, US5, US7) in parallel or sequence

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within that phase
- [Story] label (US1, US2, etc.) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD CRITICAL**: Verify tests fail (Red) before implementing (Green), then refactor
- Commit after each logical task group or checkpoint
- Use `dotnet-docker/dotnet` wrapper for ALL .NET operations (per constitution)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All tests must pass before merging: `dotnet-docker/dotnet test`
- Swagger documentation auto-generated but enhance with XML comments and examples
