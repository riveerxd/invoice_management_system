# Feature Specification: Company Invoice Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-invoice-management-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# Working Document: Proposal for "Company Invoice Management" System..."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: How should the system handle duplicate invoice numbers? → A: Invoice numbers must be globally unique across the entire system - reject any duplicate
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent edits to the same invoice? → A: Pessimistic locking - first user to open invoice for editing locks it, others must wait
- Q: How should currency be handled for invoice amounts? → A: Store amounts as decimal numbers with no currency designation - assume single implicit currency
- Q: What precision should be used for storing invoice amounts? → A: Store amounts as integers representing the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
- Q: What should be the user session timeout period? → A: 30 minutes of inactivity

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Invoice Entry (Priority: P1)

An accountant needs to record incoming and outgoing invoices in a centralized system to maintain accurate financial records. They enter essential invoice details (number, date, partner name, amount, type) and the system stores this information for future reference and reporting.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability to create and store invoices, the system has no value. This forms the foundation for all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new invoice with required fields, saving it, and verifying it can be retrieved later. Delivers immediate value by replacing manual record-keeping (spreadsheets, paper).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated accountant user, **When** they enter invoice details (number, issue date, partner name, total amount, type: received/issued) and submit, **Then** the invoice is saved and a confirmation is displayed
2. **Given** a saved invoice, **When** the accountant requests to view invoice details, **Then** all entered information is displayed accurately
3. **Given** the accountant is creating an invoice, **When** they attempt to submit with missing required fields, **Then** the system displays clear validation errors indicating which fields are required

### User Story 2 - Invoice Listing and Filtering (Priority: P1)

Company management and accounting staff need to quickly find specific invoices or groups of invoices based on criteria like date ranges, payment status, or business partner. This enables rapid decision-making and financial oversight.

**Why this priority**: Without search and filtering, users must manually scan through all invoices, making the system unusable as invoice volume grows. This is essential for daily operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple invoices with different attributes, then applying various filters (date range, payment status, partner name) to verify correct results are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple invoices exist in the system, **When** a user filters by date range (e.g., "last month"), **Then** only invoices with issue dates within that range are displayed
2. **Given** invoices with different payment statuses, **When** a user filters for "unpaid" invoices, **Then** only unpaid invoices are shown
3. **Given** invoices from multiple business partners, **When** a user searches by partner name, **Then** only invoices matching that partner are displayed
4. **Given** the user applies multiple filters (e.g., unpaid invoices from a specific partner), **When** filters are combined, **Then** results match all applied criteria

---

### User Story 3 - Invoice Modification (Priority: P2)

Accountants occasionally need to correct errors in invoice data (wrong amount, incorrect company name, typo in invoice number). The system allows authorized users to edit existing invoices to maintain data accuracy.

**Why this priority**: Data accuracy is critical for financial records, but this is secondary to being able to create and find invoices. Users can work around missing edit functionality temporarily by deleting and recreating invoices.

**Independent Test**: Create an invoice, edit one or more fields, save changes, and verify the updated data persists and displays correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing invoice, **When** an accountant modifies invoice details and saves, **Then** the changes are persisted and reflected in subsequent views
2. **Given** an invoice being edited, **When** the accountant enters invalid data (e.g., negative amount), **Then** validation errors prevent saving
3. **Given** an invoice, **When** a user without edit permissions attempts to modify it, **Then** the system prevents the modification

---

### User Story 4 - Payment Status Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users need to track which invoices have been paid and which remain outstanding. This enables financial reporting, cash flow management, and identification of overdue payments.

**Why this priority**: Essential for financial management but can be handled manually in early stages. More critical as invoice volume increases.

**Independent Test**: Mark invoices as paid/unpaid, filter by payment status, and verify counts and totals are accurate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an invoice record, **When** the accountant marks it as paid and provides payment date, **Then** the payment status updates and is visible in invoice lists
2. **Given** invoices with various payment statuses, **When** management views a summary report, **Then** totals for paid and unpaid invoices are displayed accurately
3. **Given** an unpaid invoice past its due date, **When** viewing the invoice list, **Then** overdue invoices are clearly indicated

---

### User Story 5 - Data Export for Accounting (Priority: P2)

Accounting staff need to export invoice data in standard formats for integration with external accounting software, tax preparation, and regulatory compliance.

**Why this priority**: Important for workflow integration and compliance, but manual data entry can serve as a workaround initially.

**Independent Test**: Export a set of invoices and verify the output file contains all required data in the expected format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a filtered set of invoices, **When** the user requests an export, **Then** a file is generated containing all invoice data in a structured format (CSV or similar)
2. **Given** an export request, **When** the export completes, **Then** the file includes all mandatory fields and can be opened in standard spreadsheet software
3. **Given** all invoices in the system, **When** a regulator requests full export, **Then** the system can generate a complete archive of all records

---

### User Story 6 - Role-Based Access Control (Priority: P3)

Different user types (accountants, managers, administrators) need appropriate access levels. Accountants can create and edit invoices, managers can view and filter but not modify, and administrators manage users and system configuration.

**Why this priority**: Important for security and audit trails in production, but can be deferred for initial MVP if the system is used in a controlled environment.

**Independent Test**: Log in as different user roles and verify each role can only perform authorized actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with "Manager" role, **When** they attempt to create or edit an invoice, **Then** the action is prevented
2. **Given** a user with "Accountant" role, **When** they attempt to delete an invoice, **Then** the action is prevented (only administrators can delete)
3. **Given** a user with "Administrator" role, **When** they access user management, **Then** they can create, modify, and deactivate user accounts

---

### User Story 7 - Invoice Deletion (Priority: P3)

Administrators need the ability to remove erroneous invoice entries (e.g., test data, duplicate entries, data entry mistakes) while maintaining audit trails for compliance.

**Why this priority**: Useful for data hygiene but not critical for daily operations. Edit functionality can address most correction needs.

**Independent Test**: Delete an invoice as an administrator and verify it no longer appears in searches, while non-admin users cannot delete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an invoice and an administrator user, **When** the administrator deletes the invoice, **Then** it is removed from all views and searches
2. **Given** a deleted invoice, **When** the system is audited, **Then** a record of the deletion (who, when, which invoice) is preserved
3. **Given** a non-administrator user, **When** they attempt to delete an invoice, **Then** the action is prevented

---

### Edge Cases

- How does the system handle invoices with very large amounts (millions or billions)?
- What happens if a user tries to filter by an invalid date range (e.g., end date before start date)?
- How does the system respond when no invoices match the applied filters?
- What happens if an invoice's due date is in the past when it's created?
- How does the system handle special characters or very long text in partner names?
- How does the system handle export requests for very large datasets (thousands of invoices)?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Invoice**: Represents a financial document for goods or services. Key attributes include: globally unique invoice number (enforced across all invoice types), issue date, due date, type (received from supplier or issued to customer), partner name, total amount (stored as integer representing smallest currency unit such as cents, without currency designation - single implicit currency assumed), payment status (paid/unpaid), payment date (when paid), and creation/modification timestamps. Invoices are associated with a user (who created/modified) and must be preserved for regulatory compliance.

- **Business Partner**: Represents a supplier (for received invoices) or customer (for issued invoices). Key attributes include: name, and identifier. A business partner can be associated with multiple invoices over time.

- **User**: Represents a person who uses the system. Key attributes include: username, email, role (Accountant/Manager/Administrator), and active status. Users create and modify invoices, and their actions are tracked for audit purposes.

- **Audit Log Entry**: Represents a record of sensitive system actions (particularly deletions). Key attributes include: timestamp, user who performed the action, action type, affected invoice identifier, and any relevant details.

## Assumptions

- The system will be deployed as a web application accessible via standard web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- PostgreSQL database is available in a Docker container as specified in the requirements
- Users have stable internet connectivity for accessing the web application
- Business partner information is limited to name and basic identification; complex vendor/customer management is out of scope
- All invoice amounts are stored as integers representing the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents) without explicit currency designation - a single implicit currency is assumed for all invoices (multi-currency support deferred to future versions)
- VAT/tax calculation and tracking is out of scope for MVP (noted in original requirements)
- The system will be used within a single organization (multi-tenant/SaaS deployment is out of scope)
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures will be handled at the infrastructure level, not within the application (FR-020 10-year retention requirement satisfied via infrastructure backup policies, not application logic)
- User authentication uses session-based authentication with 30-minute timeout (OAuth2/OIDC deferred to future versions)
- The system does not need to integrate with existing accounting software via APIs in the MVP (export functionality is sufficient)
- Invoice approval workflows (requiring multiple signatures/approvals) are out of scope
- The system will support a single language interface (internationalization deferred)
